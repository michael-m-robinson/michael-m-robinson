I will start by thanking you for taking the time to read this page. As you know, my name is Michael. I am a computer enthusiast; my love for this medium started when I was a child. I struggled in many areas, but understood computers well. In grade school, I spent all of my time going to the computer lab and creating silly, imaginative stories only a child could. Programs like hyper-studio and Kid-pix filled my afternoons with so much fun, I am thankful for those times.

When I became an adult, I discovered that I didn't enjoy IT because working with computers is different from understanding them and working with people. I am an introvert, you see, so customer facing jobs aren’t a good fit for me. This led me to programming. I wish I was honest with myself from the start, and entertained this area of curiosity further than I did in college. 

Part of what drove my decision to major in Information Technology was I found it doable. I never in a million years would have considered myself capable of professional coding. If there’s anyone struggling with this, my advice to you is to follow your heart. It’s better to follow your dreams than to settle. 

I am learning Python and React, although I find vanilla JavaScript and HTML5 more fun to develop on the front end. Lately, I’ve been learning the ropes of ASP.NET development. I switched to Python because it’s popular and enjoyable to work with.

I’m new to this, but I’m willing to help with your project if needed. My email is:

Thanks again, have a great day. 👋🏾
